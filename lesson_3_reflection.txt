Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork is cloning a remote repository onto your repository on github for tweaking changes.
  Cloning is making a copy from a github repository onto your local machine or making a copy of a repository on your local machine to another folder on your local machine.
  Branches is making another experimental or feature commit in the same repository in your local machine
